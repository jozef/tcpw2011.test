<h2>Getting to Vienna</h2>

<h3>... by plane</h3>

<p>Vienna's main airport is <b><a href="http://www.viennaairport.com">Vienna
International Airport</a> (VIE)</b>, which offers connections to most major cities
in Europe and the rest of the world. The airport is connected to the city by
the <a href="http://www.cityairporttrain.at/">City Airport Train - CAT</a>
which takes 16 minutes from the airport to the city center. There's also the
regular "Schnellbahn" which takes 25 minutes and is much cheaper. If you're
arriving late (after ~23:30) you can take a bus or a taxi.</p>

<p>Both Schnellbahn and CAT stop at "Wien Mitte".</p>

<p>Alternative airports (served by low-cost carriers not going to VIE) are
Linz, Graz (both in Austria) and Bratislava (capital of Slovakia and TCPW 2011 host city).</p>

<p><b>Linz (LNZ)</b> is located  ~190km west of Vienna. There is a regular train
service going at least once an hour. The train takes 1.5 to 2 hours and costs
27.50 Euro for a single ticket.</p>

<p><b>Graz (GRZ)</b> is located ~250km south of Vienna. Trains take ~3 hours and
cost 29.70 Euro.</p>

<p><b>Bratislava (BTS)</b> is ~50km east of Vienna. 
There are various <a href="ttp://www2.skyeurope.com/en/Default.aspx?CatID=99&d=BTS&ai=1">bus
shuttle services</a> from <a href="http://www.letiskobratislava.sk">Bratislava
Airport</a>.</p>

<h3>... by train</h3>

<p>Depending on where you live, travelling to Vienna by train (especially with
an overnight sleeper) can be quite cheap and relaxing. And it's good for the
environment :-)</p>

<p>You will either arrive on Westbahnhof (if you're coming from the north and
west or Linz, eg Germany or France) or S&uuml;dbahnhof (if you're coming from
Graz, the south or east, eg Italy or SEE).</p>

<h3>... by car</h3>

<p>We do not advise you to come to Vienna by car. Parking places are scarce
and expensive. You should probably try to leave your car at the hotel parking
(if there is one) or outside Vienna (there are some Park & Ride facilities on the
outskirts from where you can catch the subway). You have to buy parking tickets 
for the inner districts (1-9 and 20, the venue is in the 9th district) 
and parking time is limited to two hours.</p>

<h3>... by bike</h3>

<p>There's a very nice and famous bike tour along the Danube from Bavaria to
Vienna called <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donauradweg">Donauradweg (in German)</a>.</p>
