<h3>Become a sponsor!</h3>

<p>If you or your company wants to give something back to the Perl community,
please consider sponsoring the Twin City Perl Workshop. We are looking for
sponsoring in any form (books, goodies, money,...). An easy way to sponsor the
event is to pay the business tariff. 

In addition to the nice and fuzzy feeling in your stomach a sponsorship will
bring you the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Logo and Link on our website.</li>
<li>Direct contact to 50+ highly motivated Perl developers, who might be
interested in working at your company.</li>
<li>Say "THANK YOU" to the Perl community, which provides high-quality and unique products (Perl itself, CPAN, ...) for free.</li>
<li>Any profit the event earns will be spend to foster further development of Perl.</li>
</ul>

For more information regaring sponsorship, please send an email to <code>twincity AT rt.useperl.at</code>
